;;  Macro TIMER1 timeout
;;
;;  The TIMER1 macro starts Timer1 in 16-bit timer mode.  The parameter
;;  points to a 16-bit number indicating how many instruction cycles should
;;  elapse before overflow (resulting in a timer interrupt).  Since overflow
;;  occurs when the timer goes from 0xffff to 0x0000, the number is negative.
;;
;;  Four system cycles correspond to one instruction cycle, so a 20MHz clock
;;  means instructions execute at 5MHz, which means each instruction takes
;;  0.2µs (200ns).  This macro should only be included in code called when
;;  Timer1 interrupts are disabled.

;;  Delay Timeout Table
;;
;;  Precalculate the inter-character and inter-frame timeout delays (in µs)
;;  for 9600, 19200, and >19200 baud.  For baud rates greater than 19200, the
;;  timeouts are fixed at 750µs and 1750µs, respectively, to reduce the CPU
;;  overhead of more frequent timer processing (see the Remark in §2.5.1.1 of
;;  the MODBUS over Serial Line Specification and Implementation guide V1.0).
;;  At slower baud rates, the inter-character timeout is 1.5 times the char-
;;  acter time, the time to transmit one character; the inter-frame timeout is
;;  3.5 times the character time.
;;
;;  Note that the values below are negative, since the timer interrupt fires
;;  when the timer overflows from 0xffff to 0x0000.  Also note that the timer
;;  is incremented every instruction cycle (kFrequency / 4), not every CPU
;;  cycle.
